## 📁 Files

| File Name         | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| `procedural.py`   | A simple example using procedural programming with functions and global lists. |
| `oop.py`          | Refactored to use object-oriented design with classes like `Product` and `Store`. |
| `encapsulation.py`| Enhanced version using OOP best practices with encapsulated private attributes and getter/setter methods. |
